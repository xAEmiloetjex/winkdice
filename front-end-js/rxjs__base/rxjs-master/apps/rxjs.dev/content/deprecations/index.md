# Deprecations and Breaking Changes

While the core team always tries to limit changes, sometimes we have to deprecate APIs or do breaking changes for various reasons. 
This section aims to describe some of the deprecations and breaking changes we did more in detail. Some of the changes are to extensive to describe
them appropriately in a changelog. Additionally, we can provide code examples in the documentation, to make required changes more comprehensible and therefore
lower migration efforts.

Do notice that this is not a complete list, please see the [changelog](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the complete list.
