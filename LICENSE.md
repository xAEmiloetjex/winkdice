    <h4>Side note from me a year later..</h4><br/>
    I am aware that my wording may be a bit.. direct and un-kind,<br/>
    I wasn't in my best mood when i wrote it so please be aware of that,<br/>
    That said however.. i still stand by it,<br/>
    It's my code, that i wrote.. i see my code as an art-form,<br/>
    and the fact that this text is in every web page as well as a seperate page,<br/>
    and the fact that this applies to ALL code found on this site,<br/>
    means that it is in fact copyrighted and in no way grant i the permission for ANYONE to claim it as their own!
    </li>
    <li><h4>The project as a whole:</h4>
        <ol>
            1. Just don't use any of my code for commercial use without my permission<br/>
            2. Do not tell people that my code is your code / claim that it's your own (there is a difference but just don't do either of them)<br/>
            3. Do not be a dick<br/>
            4. if you so use my code then credit me and the page where you got the code<br/>
            5. You cannot patent any part of your program where you use my code<br/>
            6. I am not liable for any vulnerabilities that my code may bring into your program nor do i give you the warranty/guarantee of the following things:
            <ul>
              - that my code is performant<br/>
              - that my code is secure<br/>
              - that i won't backdoor it so that i can disable functions in case of a break of this license<br/>
              - that i won't change the terms of this license
            </ul>
            <br/>
            7. The license terms on this page are the ones that are valid, if you do not update your license and i change the terms and you break said new terms then you are liable<br/>
            8. These are my terms that i set for my code, this license is valid since it's not only on every page in the devtools, but also it has it's own page<br/>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
